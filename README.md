# Qubit-State-Graph
#Work in progress

#Background: 
#Graph states are certain qubit states that be represented by graphs, using vertices to represent qubits and edges to represent something like entanglement.
Quantum gates can be represented graphically


#This will eventually be an algorithm that will take two states of the same set of qubits(represented by graphs) and output the least amount of transformations to get from one state to the other using only 
#flipping edges, local complementation, and CNOTS
